## Multimodal_RAG

Multimodal RAG is an end-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that supports multimodal document processing. This notebook demonstrates how to parse PDFs, extract structured content (including text and images), and prepare inputs for large language models.

### ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Parses and chunks PDFs using unstructured
âœ… Extracts both text and images using high-resolution strategies
âœ… Embeds documents using OpenAI Embeddings API
âœ… Stores and queries chunks via FAISS vector index
âœ… Supports RAG-style question answering using OpenAI's GPT models
âœ… Interactive querying for factual answers from parsed documents
